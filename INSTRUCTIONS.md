CODE CHALLENGE

MiniVenmo! Imagine that your phone and wallet are trying to have a beautiful
baby. In order to make this happen, you must write a social payment app.
Implement a program that will feature users, credit cards, and payment feeds.


Questions:
1. Complete the `MiniVenmo.create_user()` method to allow our application to create new users.


2. Complete the `User.pay()` method to allow users to pay each other. Consider the following: if user A is paying user B, user's A balance should be used if there's enough balance to cover the whole payment, if not, user's A credit card should be charged instead.


3. Venmo has the Feed functionality, that shows the payments that users have been doing in the app. If Bobby paid Carol $5, and then Carol paid Bobby $15, it should look something like this


Bobby paid Carol $5.00 for Coffee
Carol paid Bobby $15.00 for Lunch


Implement the `User.retrieve_activity()` and `MiniVenmo.render_feed()` methods so the MiniVenmo application can render the feed.


4. Now users should be able to add friends. Implement the `User.add_friend()` method to allow users to add friends.
5. Now modify the methods involved in rendering the feed to also show when user's added each other as friends.


Note: you should implement the Unit Tests in order to check that your code is working
